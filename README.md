# Regex
the implement of Regular expression engine



i use the Approach presented in the book 《engineering a compiler》

Regular Expression---Thompson’s Construction --->ε-NFA

ε-NFA--- The Subset Construction--->DFA

DFA---Brzozowski’s Algorithm--->minimal DFA

then we have the DFA to match string.
